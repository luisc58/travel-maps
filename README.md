# A-Frame Boilerplate

Boilerplate for creating WebVR scenes with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io).

Alternatively, check out the [A-Frame Starter on
glitch.com](https://glitch.com/~aframe) for a more interactive way on getting
started.

## Getting Started


### <small><sup>1:</sup> Clone this Git repo 🍴🐙

    git clone https://github.com/mecs13/World-Travel-Maps.git
    cd world-travel-maps && npm install && npm start
    open http://localhost:3000/

> :iphone: **Mobile pro tip:** Upon starting the development server, the URL will be logged to the console. Load that URL from a browser on your mobile device. (If your mobile phone and computer are not on the same LAN, consider using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for local development and testing. [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/) is also worth a gander.)

### Installation

First make sure you have Node installed.

On Mac OS X, it's recommended to use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install Node + [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

    brew install node

To install the Node dependencies:

    npm install


### Local Development

To serve the site from a simple Node development server:

    npm start

Then launch the site from your favourite browser:

[__http://localhost:3000/__](http://localhost:3000/)

If you wish to serve the site from a different port:

    PORT=8000 npm start
